***Open Table Demo***

This is a full-stack app designed to consume the open-table API.

To see this live, go to https://opentabledemo.herokuapp.com/

I am using React, Redux, Axios, and AntDesign (for React Design Framework) on the front-end and Express in the back-end.

To run the app:

You must have NodeJS installed locally.

in the command line type -

- "git clone"                         - Clone this repo.
- "cd (insert directory nanme here)"  - Access Root Directory.
- "npm install"                       - Install dependencies.
- "node server.js"                    - Launch app locally. 

Go to http://localhost:3000/ to see app in your default browser.
